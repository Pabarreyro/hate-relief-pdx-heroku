<h2>About Hate Relief</h2>
<p><strong>Hate Relief PDX</strong> is a web app where Portlanders can report hate crime/incidents and find resources they need to heal or take action. The functionality is modeled after Hatecrimehelp.com, a website that displays legal resources for targets of hate incidents based on the nature and location of the incident.</p>

<p><strong>Hate Relief PDX</strong> expands on this functionality by displaying local community-based organizations and government agencies that provide other resources (<em>e.g.</em>, trainings, mental health guidance, safe space, advocacy and political action). Users will also have the option of submitting their reports non-anonymously, in which case their reports will be made available to the relevant CBOs and/or agencies for those organizations to follow up.</p>
